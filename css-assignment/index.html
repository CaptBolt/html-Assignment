            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p> My name is Oladosu Hassan, and my journey towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is a testament to my unwavering dedication and resilience.  Having recently completed my National Certificate of Education (NCE) in Computer Science, I am now re-embarking on this path, driven by an unyielding passion for the field and a desire to contribute to its transformative potential.I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient applications. I have a background in computer science and a deep interest in problem-solving and innovation.</p>
            <p>My academic journey began with a deep fascination for the intricate workings of technology.  However, financial instability forced me to put my studies on hold a few years ago in AltSchool Africa School of Engineering, leaving me with a sense of unfinished business.  Despite this setback, my passion for computer science never waned.  I continued to learn independently, refining my skills and expanding my knowledge base.  This period of self-directed learning has only strengthened my resolve to pursue a formal education and contribute to the field at a professional level.</p>
